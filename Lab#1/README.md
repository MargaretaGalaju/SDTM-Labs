Introduction/Theory
----------
In software engineering, the creational design patterns are the general solutions that deal with object creation, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by optimizing, hiding or controlling the object creation.
Some examples of this kind of design patterns are :

Singleton
Builder
Prototype
Object Pooling
Factory Method
Abstract Factory
